This directory contains code snippets that are included into
AC_TRY_COMPILE/AC_COMPILE_IFELSE, AC_TRY_CPP/AC_PREPROC_IFELSE,
AC_TRY_RUN/AC_RUN_IFELSE, etc clauses in configure.

They have no standalone value.

Tests are named X-zzz.ext where 'yyy' is a semi-descrptive name, 'ext' is an
appropriate extension for the language, and 'X' is

  c - compile test
  l - link test
  p - preprocessor test
  r - run test

Note that the extension used for the file is irrelevant to the compiler, it's
only effect is on editors' language recognition.

Where the autoconf macro in use accepts separate 'includes' and
'function-body' parameters, it is recommended that one of these be left
blank with '[]' and the other consist only of
'[#include "autoconf/testcode/x-yyy.ext"]'

In general, it's not worth the maintenance trouble to extract simple tests
into separate files here; these should be reserved for more complicated tests
that are easier to maintain as separate source files.
